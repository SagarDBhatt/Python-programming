In this course, join Christian Hur as he steps through how to build dynamic web apps using Python and Flask, the popular Python web framework. After demonstrating how to set up your environment, Christian shows how to create a Flask project, work with templates, and set up and configure a database system for your app—in this case, Flask-MongoEngine—to help store and track data.
